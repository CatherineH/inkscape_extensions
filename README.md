Catherine's Inkscape Extensions
-------------------------------

My inkscape extensions. Designed to work with python3/inkscape > 1.0.

Pattern to Path
===============

If a path's fill is a &langle;pattern&rangle; element, remove the fill and create the path so that it looks the same for svg viewers that don't render patterns.

Requires my python bindings to livarot (https://github.com/CatherineH/livarot_pybind) in order to work
